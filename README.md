# Pedestrian Safety on Busy Roads

## Details
The aim of this project is to design an effective traffic control system
and safety of pedestrians (or animals) trying to cross the road. This
system can monitor a busy cross-section of 4 roads in developing
countries, where there are not only pedestrians trying to cross the road,
but animals as well, this monitoring system is implemented with
sensors on the road, footpath and LDR utilizing streetlights.
The uniquiness of this project is that the safety of pedestrians
comes first, with Automatic streetlights that turn on on nightfall,
buzzer that sounds to alert the vehicles that there is a pedestrian/
animal trying to cross the road and the 4 traffic signals, that turn on
and off based on the density of the traffic, more details can be found on my portfolio.
